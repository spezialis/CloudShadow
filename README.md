# Cloud Shadow

We live simultaneously in a physical and a digital world, were these reality mirrors each other. How could our digital shadows look like?

The idea behind this project is to capture the movement of a dancer in time and space, as a representation of our digital traces. It is a virtual reality experience where one will discover the fragments of this mirror world. Explore and listening to the sound of the digital shadow in the cloud.
